                        behalf by any type of conveyance (“Shipper”). The Shipper might be the consignee (recipient of

                        uShip,&nbsp;Shippers may be referred to as the “Shipping Customer” or “Customer”

                        the quality, safety, or legal aspects of the transactions that take place on our website. uShip
                        does not prequalify or validate the claims or qualifications of TSPs</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>nor

                      the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). uShip does not endorse, recommend,
                      or refer any specific TSP or Shipper, nor does uShip have any control or influence over actions or
                      decisions made by users of the Service. All users of the uShip software platform make their own
                      decisions and You acknowledge and agree that we are not in any way arranging transportation or
                      shipping or logistics services on your behalf. Because we are not involved in the actual
                      transaction between Shippers and TSPs, we have no control over the accuracy of listings, the
                      ability of TSPs to transport items, or the ability of Shippers to send items. We cannot ensure the
                      Shipper or TSP will actually complete a shipment. We cannot and do not guarantee the ability of
                      users to complete or fulfill any services booked through the uShip software platform. Furthermore,
                      due to the difficulty of individual authentication, especially on the Internet, we cannot and do
                      not guarantee the verification of any user’s identity. Any identity verification methods we employ
                      are strictly on a best efforts basis and should not be solely relied upon by our users. You
                      acknowledge and agree that any and all communications, correspondence, verbal or written or by
                      electronic means, or any warranties or representations made with regard to the arrangement of
                      transportation services are not provided by us and are specifically and solely between You and the

                      contracts under applicable law. Our Services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely
                      suspended uShip users. You acknowledge that You are at least 18 years of age and you have reached
                      the age of majority in the state or jurisdiction where You live or reside. If You are not yet 18
                      years old or have not reached the age of majority in the state or jurisdiction in which You live
                      or reside,&nbsp;You may not use our Services. Your uShip account may not be transferred or sold to
                      another party. If You are registering as a business entity, you represent that You have the
                      authority to bind the entity to this agreement. If You are using our Services as a Broker, you
                      agree that you possess the authority to act as a Broker on behalf of a Shipper or TSP. Users who
                      engage in the transportation of goods must have a valid license to operate the vehicle they intend
                      to use. You agree that the uShip Services are for transportation services only and that work that
                      You provide will only involve transportation services. You agree that You will not use your
                      participation in the uShip website as a means to sell or market any types of goods or products,
                      unless specifically allowed by uShip in writing.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Shippers.&nbsp;</strong>You are responsible for reading all terms, conditions, and
                      tariffs published by TSPs when booking shipments on uShip. You are agreeing to the TSP’s terms,
                      conditions, and tariffs, and entering into a legally binding agreement with the TSP, unless the
                      transaction is prohibited by law or by this User Agreement. You acknowledge that, unless otherwise
                      noted by the TSP, pickup dates, delivery dates, and transit times are estimates only and are not
                      guaranteed. Cancellations may be requested by either party prior to services being rendered (see
                      Section 11 for additional details). A TSP reserves the right to inspect your shipment before
                      accepting it, and to refuse to transport any item prohibited by this User Agreement or by
                      law.&nbsp;<strong>IMPORTANT: uShip does not&nbsp;actively&nbsp;screen or qualify TSPs for
                        compliance with federal, state or local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to,
                        Broker compliance with the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). It is
                        recommended that You confirm such compliance directly with the TSP before services are rendered
                        by the TSP.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>6. Transportation Service Providers. </strong>You must legally be able to transport the
                      shipments You engage with through uShip. You agree that it is your sole obligation to comply with
                      all laws, rules, statutes, and regulations that may apply including any and all local, state, and
                      federal licensing requirements. TSPs agree that, through the various products and features on
                      uShip, they are solely responsible for all aspects of services, pricing, and terms they offer the
                      Shipper. Rates, services, and terms are solely provided by the TSPs and not by uShip. uShip does
                      not verify or adhere to the terms put forth by the TSP, which are available on the TSP’s public
                      profile. These TSP terms may not directly&nbsp;violate uShip’s User Agreement. You understand and
                      acknowledge that all shipment information is provided by other registered users and uShip has no
                      control over or responsibility for the accuracy of this information. You are responsible for
                      reading all of the shipment details, and by booking shipments on uShip, you are entering into a
                      legally binding agreement to complete the services as requested by the Shipper.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. Payments.&nbsp;</strong>Shippers may be given one or more payment options at the time
                      of booking with a TSP. As a part of the uShip service, some users can make online payments to one
                      another. uShip Payments is not an escrow service and each individual user is solely in control of
                      payments made through uShip. In other cases, partial payment in the form of a deposit can be made
                      through uShip with the remaining balance to be paid directly to the TSP. Some users may be
                      enrolled in Payment on Terms which allows for invoicing. uShip has no control over the payments
                      between users or the release of funds.</p>
                    <p>a) Full Pre-funded Payment: The Shipper pre-funds their uShip account with the total shipping
                      price. In some cases, the Shipper is presented with a payment code (to be shared with the TSP upon
                      completion of a shipment), and in some cases the payment is automatically released according to
                      the agreed upon terms.<br> <br> For shipments with a payment code, when delivery is completed, the
                      Customer can release payment from their account by marking the shipment as “Delivered” or giving
                      the payment code directly to the TSP, which is the equivalent of making a non-reversible cash
                      payment. TSPs can only ask for the payment code after the load is delivered when being paid
                      through uShip Payments (exception: shipments of live animals may require payment at pickup). The
                      Shipper agrees that they will release the payment to the TSP upon delivery of the shipment
                      regardless of damages, delays, or any other service level issue that might have occurred during
                      transit. uShip will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure proper disbursement of funds
                      among Shippers and TSPs; however uShip shall have no liability or be otherwise indebted to the TSP
                      if the Shipper fails to satisfy the condition of payment,&nbsp;nor will uShip be liable to the
                      Shipper for any damages, missing items, or other service level issues that occurred during the
                      shipping process.&nbsp;<strong>In consideration for the costs and resources incurred by uShip in
                        keeping the account open and undertaking such efforts, the Shipper and the TSP hereby
                        acknowledge and agree that uShip shall charge a dormancy fee on a monthly basis of 12.5%,
                        commencing 120 days following the deposit of the payment due to TSP with uShip (the “Dormancy
                        Fees”). In no event, shall the aggregate Dormancy Fees exceed the amount of the payment due to
                        TSP. &nbsp;If, 365 days after the date of booking, commercially reasonable efforts do not result
                        in the disbursement of funds, any remaining funds associated with the transaction(s) in question
                        shall be deemed forfeited and shall become property of uShip for failure by the Shipper to
                        satisfy the condition of releasing the payment code&nbsp;or term of this User
                        Agreement.&nbsp;</strong>If a Shipper refuses to release the payment, uShip cannot release
                      payment without the Shipper’s consent under any circumstance and the right to payment by the TSP
                      shall then be conditioned on the Shipper’s consent. It is the responsibility of both the TSP and
                      Shipper to resolve all monetary disputes, damage claims, breach of contract claims, etc. outside
                      of uShip. &nbsp;The Shipper and TSP acknowledge and agree that uShip shall not have any
                      obligations or liability to the TSP unless uShip fails to fulfill its explicit obligations
                      hereunder.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing shall not apply to Less-than-Truckload (“LTL”) &nbsp;shipments where the TSP and
                      Shipper have contracted for completion of a shipment to occur 120 days after booking; where the
                      Carrier fails to provide a Bill of Lading (“BOL”) to Shipper so that Shipper is unable to meet its
                      payment obligation to the Service Provider; or on any rate adjustments that occur 120 days after
                      booking.<br> <br> For pre-funded shipments without a payment code, You authorize uShip to release
                      payment in accordance with the TSP’s payment terms. The funds are made available for withdrawal by
                      the TSP’s uShip account when the payment is released or the code is submitted.&nbsp;<br> <br> b)
                      uShip Booking Deposit: Shippers pay a Shipper's service charge (see Section 9.a.2) and a deposit
                      in the amount of the TSP’s transaction fee (see Section 9.a.3) to the TSP through uShip.</p>
                    <p>This deposit is credited to the TSP’s uShip account. The deposit amount is then deducted from the
                      booked shipping price and the Shipper pays the remaining balance directly to the TSP at the agreed
                      upon time.&nbsp;<strong>The service charge and deposit are non-refundable in the event of a
                        completed shipment.</strong>&nbsp;<br> <br> c) Payment on Terms: Certain Shippers may be invited
                      to enroll in Payment on Terms. Enrollment in Payment on Terms allows Shippers to pay for their
                      shipment at a pre-specified duration after delivery. You will be invoiced based on the schedule
                      specified in the Payment on Terms agreement You sign, where You will have the opportunity to
                      review and dispute any discrepancies. Payment by the agreed upon method will be due in accordance
                      with Your written payment terms, unless disputed. If disputed, once the dispute is resolved,
                      payment will be due within 24 hours. The Shipper agrees that damages, delays, or any other service
                      level issue that might have occurred during transit is not considered a dispute within the meaning
                      of this Section 7(c).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>By booking a shipment while enrolled in Payment on Terms, You agree that the rate is based on the
                      information you’ve provided. Your invoice may be adjusted if the shipment is materially different
                      than what you’ve disclosed for reasons including, but not limited to, excessive weight, inaccurate
                      dimensions, different commodity class (“Class”), more items than listed, omission of essential
                      pickup and/or final destination details, etc. You also agree to the Carrier’s terms and
                      conditions. In the event of an overpayment, we will credit your uShip account for the difference.
                      This credit is non-refundable and can be used towards any future shipment.</p>
                    <p>uShip reserves the right to charge a late fee based on your signed Payment on Terms agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shippers enrolled in Payment on Terms agree to allow uShip to disclose trade data and accounts
                      receivable files to a third-party Business and Corporation Credit Provider.</p>
                    <p>d) Chargebacks and Reversed Payments: In the event that a Shipper successfully charges back a
                      credit or debit card payment or reverses any other payment type, then uShip will reverse the
                      payment within the Shipper and TSP accounts and the shipment would then be treated as
                      unpaid.&nbsp;<strong><br> <br> </strong>Unwarranted chargebacks or payment reversals initiated by
                      uShip&nbsp;users&nbsp;are prohibited,&nbsp; will result in the suspension of your uShip account,
                      and may result in uShip pursuing any and all options at its disposal to collect the withdrawn
                      funds including, but not limited to, sending your unpaid account to a third-party collection
                      agency. In the event that shipping services were not performed, all users must abide by the uShip
                      cancellation policy described in Section 11 below. The uShip cancellation process ensures the
                      integrity of the feedback system and accuracy of any refund.&nbsp;<br> <br> There are situations
                      where a chargeback may be warranted, such as when a user feels that their card or payment method
                      has been charged fraudulently. Prior to any chargeback initiation, uShip must be notified by the
                      cardholder so that uShip may investigate the claim to determine if a chargeback is appropriate. A
                      chargeback may not be filed as a replacement, or an addition to, a cancellation of a uShip
                      transaction.&nbsp;<br> <br> If an unwarranted chargeback of the Shipper’s payment is initiated and
                      accepted by the payment processor or other entity, uShip reserves the right to charge the TSP for
                      any costs associated with the chargeback. If a chargeback is accepted, the TSP becomes responsible
                      for that invoiceable amount<span
                        style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>8. Pricing and Price Changes.&nbsp;</strong>uShip does not set or control prices offered
                      by Shippers or TSPs. Quotes and offers Shippers receive from TSPs are required to be all-inclusive
                      based on the information Shippers provide; however, if the actual shipment characteristics are
                      materially different than specified by the Shipper and result in changes such as but not limited
                      to equipment required, space required, accessorial services required, all duties, customs
                      assessments, governmental penalties and fines, taxes, and legal costs allocable to shipments, then
                      TSPs may invoice a different amount than the original quote, and the Booking Party shall be
                      responsible for all additional costs incurred.</p>
                    <p>For the LTL Published Rate format only, fuel surcharges shown at the time of booking are those
                      that are in effect at the time of booking and are subject to change depending on the fuel
                      surcharge rate effective on the actual pickup date. In the event the shipper does not list Class,
                      then the density of the shipment will be calculated and converted to the appropriate Class based
                      on the conversion chart below, which is based on the National Motor Freight Classification
                      Guide.&nbsp;Transit time will not affect the final invoice price unless specifically stated in the
                      TSP’s rules tariff.&nbsp;Transit times are not guaranteed by uShip. &nbsp;If the dimensions and/or
                      weight of the shipment vary from the original quote, the TSP may charge additional amounts above
                      the quoted price and the Booking Party shall be responsible for all additional costs incurred.
                      TSPs may require the use of additional equipment and/or services to complete delivery of a
                      shipment, in such cases, the TSP may invoice the Shipper to reflect the additional transportation
                      costs and the Booking Party shall be responsible for payment of all additional
                      charges.&nbsp;Shippers will be notified of any price changes or new fees that are requested
                      through uShip and uShip will charge the Shipper’s payment method on file within 48 hours. In the
                      event that a shipment is re-rated and the resulting amount due is less than the amount initially
                      quoted and paid through uShip Payments, a uShip account credit equal to the difference between the
                      amount initially paid and the adjusted invoice amount will be applied to the Shipper’s uShip
                      account. Credits may be applied toward booking any other shipment within one year of the date of
                      issuance, otherwise they will expire. Shippers should contact Member Support regarding refund
                      requests, questions or concerns about their uShip account credits.</p>

                        See Section 11 below for the cancellation policy. TSPs that have excessive cancellations at the
                        time a shipment is booked will have a variable surcharge added to the TSP transaction fee. The
                        TSP’s transaction fee will incur an excessive cancellation surcharge based on the TSP’s previous
                        12-month cancellation rate on uShip.&nbsp;uShip reserves the right to impose an excessive
                        cancellation fee for cancellation rates above 10% based on the schedule detailed&nbsp;<a

                      for any reason, a fee of USD $50.00 will be debited to your uShip account.</p>
                    <p class="wysiwyg-indent5">3. Unpaid Balance Fees. If, for any reason, any unpaid balances have not
                      been received or in any manner realized by uShip on matches that have been completed by You for
                      the services and any additional services performed by You ("Unpaid Balances"), You agree to pay
                      such Unpaid Balance immediately. If in any billing period, we are not able to collect the full
                      Unpaid Balance from your available uShip account balance, we reserve the right to charge your
                      payment method on file for the balance(s) associated. uShip reserves the right to charge your
                      account an Unpaid Balance penalty of 5% of the total cost or USD $10, whichever is greater, and
                      hold your account until the debt has been settled if not paid within 5 days of debt creation. If
                      the balance remains unpaid for 30 days, the account in question will be suspended. If the Unpaid
                      Balance is not addressed within 60 days, the account in question will be sent to collections.</p>
                    <p class="wysiwyg-indent5">In addition, uShip may charge interest, in the amount of 1.5% per month
                      or fraction thereof on any unpaid account balance that You maintain. Any partial payments made to
                      users’ account balances will first be applied to the most recent fees owed to uShip. If at any
                      time after 30 days we cannot collect any fees owed to us, we may suspend or terminate your
                      account, or, at our sole discretion, take any additional action necessary to collect the Unpaid
                      Balance. uShip reserves the right to waive or change our fees, penalties, or interest charged at
                      any time. uShip also reserves the right to prevent You from changing your transactional currency
                      until You have paid all Unpaid Balances. You also agree to pay any costs of collection incurred by
                      us with respect to any Unpaid Balance. You also consent and authorize us to, in our sole
                      discretion, make appropriate reports to third-party credit collection agencies, credit reporting
                      agencies, financial institutions, tax agencies, and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate
                      with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution. If you are enrolled in Pay on Terms,
                      uShip reserves the right to enforce Unpaid Balance fees in accordance with the repayment schedule
                      outlined in the Pay on Terms User Agreement addendum.</p>

                      identified for uShip. You agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid credit card or
                      bank account on file with us while engaging in activity with the uShip Services. You agree that if

                      uShip. We reserve our rights to all actions and remedies in connection with any monies owed to
                      uShip.</p>

                      performed. Cancellations should only be requested after reasonable attempts have been made to
                      reach an agreeable solution and it is certain that the services that were booked on uShip will not
                      be performed. When You request a cancellation, the other party will be notified and will have the
                      opportunity to respond by either:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepting the cancellation and your
                          reason;</span></li>
                      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepting the cancellation but
                          providing their own reason and/or comments; or</span></li>
                      <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disputing the cancellation and
                          requesting review by uShip staff.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your request for cancellation is accepted by the other party, the match will be cancelled and
                      the shipment can either be relisted or deleted. If your cancellation request is disputed by the
                      other member, then the request will be sent to uShip and a determination will be made on allowing
                      or not allowing the cancellation. If the other party does not respond, the cancellation and reason
                      will be automatically accepted.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Refunds and Credits. For all cancelled shipments booked using
                        the Booking Deposit payment method, the Shipper deposit and/or the Shipper Service Charge will
                        be collected by uShip as our cancellation fee. &nbsp;At uShip's sole discretion, and on a
                        case-by-case basis, we may offer the cancellation fee as a discount to a future transaction;
                        provided, however, that in such cases (i) the right to such discount shall be conditioned, and
                        may be given in consideration for the Shipper consummating a future transaction with uShip
                        within 365 days following the issuance of such credit, and (ii) such discount shall have no cash
                        value and shall not be transferable. A Shipper may receive a full refund of the booked shipment
                        price and Shipper Service Charge for cancelled uShip Payments transactions up to 120 days after
                        the booking date. A refund can only be given if the uShip Payments payment code has not been
                        released to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TSP.&nbsp;</span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">b) Excessive Cancellations. Every TSP is allowed 1 cancellation for
                        every 10 booked shipments without penalty, with your total booked shipments always rounded up to
                        the nearest 10. Each cancellation above this allowance is considered to be excessive, and TSPs
                        that have excessive cancellations at the time a bid is placed or an offer is accepted will have
                        a variable surcharge added to their transaction fee. The cancellation rate is equal to the total
                        number of cancellations divided by the total number of matches. The TSP’s transaction fee will
                        incur an excess cancellation surcharge (see section 9.d.1) based on the TSP’s previous 12-month
                        cancellation rate on uShip. If a Brokered Load is automatically cancelled because the Shipper to
                        Broker transaction has been cancelled, the cancellation will not be posted on the Carrier’s
                        profile or count as an excessive&nbsp;</span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">cancellation.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>12. Mobile Application Usage.&nbsp;</strong>When using the Services on a mobile device
                      and/or the uShip mobile application, you shall: (i) observe all traffic laws and otherwise drive
                      safely; (ii) use your good personal judgment while driving, (iii) not interact with the app,
                      unless your vehicle is stationary and legally parked; (iv) not use the Services for any illegal,
                      unauthorized, unintended, unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful purposes.</p>
                    <p>uShip does not warrant that the mobile application will be compatible or interoperable with your
                      mobile device or any other piece of hardware, software, or equipment. Furthermore, you acknowledge
                      that compatibility and interpretability problems can cause the performance of your mobile device
                      to diminish or fail completely, and may result in permanent damage to your mobile device, and
                      corruption of the software of and files located on your mobile device, and uShip shall have no
                      liability should these problems arise. You assume all responsibility and risk for the use of the
                      uShip Services and mobile applications.&nbsp;<br> <br> You may only access the Service using
                      authorized means. It is your responsibility to check to ensure you download the correct
                      application for your device. uShip is not liable if you do not have a compatible mobile device or
                      if you download the wrong version of the application for your mobile device. uShip reserves the
                      right to terminate the Service and the use of the application should you be using the Service or

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>13. Bills of Lading. </strong>For certain shipments and for the convenience of the
                      parties to a shipment, uShip generates an electronic and/or printable bill of lading utilizing the
                      booking information provided by both parties for your use in tendering the shipment. The bill of
                      lading issued in connection with each shipment is non-negotiable and shall be deemed,
                      conclusively, to have been prepared by You, the Shipper. The parties agree that uShip does not
                      issue the bill of lading and that uShip is not a party to the bill of lading. For certain TSPs, a
                      failure by the Shipper to provide the bill of lading generated via uShip to the selected TSP may
                      result in the loss of the quoted rate. If the Shipper makes changes to a shipment after booking,
                      then the Shipper is required to either make changes to the bill of lading or cancel the shipment
                      and rebook with current information. TSPs shall have no obligation to honor rate quotes in any of
                      the following instances: any alteration of the bill of lading, or tendering of shipments to any
                      Carrier other than the selected TSP, or the use of a bill of lading not generated via the uShip
                      software platform. These terms and conditions apply when using the Standard Bill of Lading
                      available on uShip:&nbsp;<a

                    <p><strong>14. Carrier Cargo Claims and Carrier Limitations of Liability.&nbsp;</strong>As a neutral
                      venue, uShip does not set terms specific to Carrier cargo liability. Except where otherwise
                      provided by the Carrier via the uShip software platform, the Carrier liability for any cargo
                      damage, loss, or theft from any cause shall be determined under the presiding, applicable law. All
                      cargo claims should be submitted immediately by the Shipper to the selected TSP to help ensure
                      timely resolution, and uShip shall have no liability or responsibility for same. The Shipper may
                      not offset freight or other charges against claims for any loss, damage, misdelivery, or
                      non-delivery. Where provided by the Carrier through uShip, the liability for cargo loss offered
                      will be determined by the individual Carrier’s governing General Rules Tariff or terms and
                      conditions in effect at the time of shipment. If a shipment contains freight with a predetermined
                      exception value, as determined by the selected Carrier, the maximum exception liability will
                      override the otherwise standard liability for cargo loss. The maximum amount that a Shipper may
                      recover on a cargo claim will be that which is recoverable under the Carrier’s published liability
                      limits and/or tariffs. The Shipper agrees that by booking a shipment on uShip they have been
                      afforded a choice of reasonable liability rates for the protection of all freight shipped, and
                      voluntarily chosen the released rates and limits published by Carriers through the uShip software
                      platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>15. uShip Cargo Insurance.&nbsp;</strong>On certain shipments, Shippers may have the
                      option to purchase the uShip Cargo Insurance coverage offered by Lloyd’s of London through Roanoke
                      and McGriff, Seibels &amp; Williams. By accepting and/or purchasing uShip Cargo Insurance during
                      the booking process, You agree to the terms and conditions under the&nbsp;<a

                      detailed in the policy and acknowledge that uShip Cargo Insurance, if purchased, is non-refundable
                      except in the case of a completed cancellation. uShip has no responsibility, liability, or
                      involvement in the issue of insurance, the denial of insurance, or in the processing or payment of

                      reject or suspend your participation, or remove You from your current participation, with the
                      uShip Services at any time and for any reason or for no reason and without notice to You. We are
                      not liable for any damage or loss resulting from such hold, suspension, or removal. Events and
                      scenarios that may result in the suspension or removal of your participation include but are not
                      limited to: flagging; abusive or hostile behavior; unresolved disputes; creating and/or
                      maintaining multiple accounts or relation to other accounts; committing fraud or violating this
                      User Agreement; and, poor performance on the site (high cancellations, negative feedback, etc.).
                      uShip has no obligation to disclose the reason for actions taken under this section. All decisions
                      are final.</p>
                    <p><strong>19. Feedback.&nbsp;</strong>For each uShip transaction, the Shipper and TSP are allowed
                      to rate each other by leaving feedback for one another. TSPs leave feedback directly through uShip
                      whereas Shippers leave feedback through third-party platform Yotpo. You agree Your use of Yotpo is
                      subject to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/terms-of-service-120519/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">Yotpo Terms of Service</a>. Feedback should be left only after a shipment has
                      been delivered or a cancellation has been completed. Feedback for TSPs consists of the Shipper
                      leaving a star rating (with a 1-star rating being the lowest and a 5-star rating being the
                      highest), writing a short comment about their experience with the TSP, and indicating if they
                      would or would not work with the TSP again for future shipments. Feedback for Shippers consists of
                      the TSP leaving a rating (positive, negative, or neutral) and writing a short comment about their
                      experience with the Shipper. You acknowledge that your feedback consists of comments left by other
                      uShip users and a composite feedback score compiled by uShip. You agree that You will not use your
                      uShip feedback in any venue other than uShip. Users should always use caution and good judgment
                      when leaving feedback for another user because You could be held legally responsible for damages
                      to a user’s reputation if a court were to find that the remarks constitute libel or defamation.
                      Under federal law (the Communications Decency Act), because uShip does not censor feedback or
                      investigate it for accuracy, uShip is not legally responsible for the remarks that users post,
                      even if those remarks are defamatory. However, this law does not protect the person who leaves the
                      feedback from responsibility for it.</p>
                    <p>a) Feedback Calculations for TSPs. Feedback scores for TSPs are calculated after completion of a
                      shipment when a Shipper opts to answer the question "Would you use this transporter again?" The
                      Shipper can select&nbsp;<em>thumbs up</em>(yes, +1) or&nbsp;<em>thumbs down</em>(no, -1). The
                      <strong>“Would Use Again</strong>” percentage reflects the number of <em>thumbs up (+1)</em> or
                      <em>thumbs down (-1)</em> ratings received by a TSP. Star ratings are calculated when a Shipper
                      rates a TSP’s services between 1 and 5 stars (with 1-star rating being the lowest and a 5-star
                      rating being the highest) after either completion or cancellation of a shipment.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Feedback Calculations for Shippers. Feedback scores for
                        Shippers are calculated when a TSP gives a Shipper a positive (+1), neutral (0), or negative
                        (-1) score. A Shipper’s overall feedback score is the difference between the number of TSPs who
                        left a positive rating and the number of TSPs who left a negative rating. A TSP can only
                        influence a Shipper’s feedback score by one positive, one negative, or one neutral rating. When
                        a TSP leaves more than one of a particular type of feedback for a Shipper, for example three
                        positive ratings for three different transactions, the Shipper’s score only increases by +1.
                        While the score is only increased by +1, each of the feedback comments left by the TSP are made
                        available for the community to read in the Feedback Received section of a Shipper’s profile.
                        Likewise, if a TSP leaves three positive ratings and two negative ratings, only one of the
                        positives and one of the negatives will count towards a Shipper’s feedback score, resulting in a
                        net score of zero.&nbsp;<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">c) Resolving Feedback Disputes.</span></p>
                    <p>To maintain the integrity of the feedback system, feedback left for a user is a permanent part of
                      that user’s profile. Feedback comments cannot be edited at a later date. Users should resolve any
                      misunderstandings prior to leaving feedback, as most misunderstandings can and are resolved
                      quickly through direct communication. There may be times when You are unhappy with, disagree with,
                      or regret feedback that You left for another user, or that may have been left for You. If You have
                      a disagreement over feedback that has been left, You have the following options to respond:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Reply to Feedback Received. Share your side of the story by responding to any comment that has
                        been left for you. Your response will be shown directly below the comment left by the other
                        uShip user.</li>
                      <li>Mutual Feedback Withdrawal. If both users are able to resolve a problem after feedback has
                        been left, You can mutually agree to withdraw the feedback rating and comment. Both users must
                        agree, and feedback will be withdrawn at the same time upon confirmation of the request by both
                        users.</li>
                      <li>Feedback Comment Withdrawal. uShip will remove individual feedback comments only in very rare
                        circumstances, such as but not limited to, when they violate certain uShip policies and
                        instances when uShip receives a valid court order to remove feedback<span
                          style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">.</span>

                      are otherwise governed by Section 35 of this User Agreement. We will attempt to resolve any
                      disputes between you and another user through customer support protocols. Because we are a neutral
                      venue, however, we are not responsible for successfully resolving any disputes, nor are we
                      responsible for any decisions made or actions taken in a reasonable effort to assist in the
                      resolution of a dispute involving You. If You report a dispute to uShip, we will make reasonable
                      efforts to help both parties communicate; however, all disputes must be resolved directly between
                      You and the other party. Therefore, if we are contacted by a user who claims to have a dispute
                      with You regarding transactions completed on uShip and they request your contact information
                      (including, but not limited to, any of your provided phone numbers and/or addresses) to settle the
                      dispute, You expressly authorize us to release your provided contact information to the uShip user
                      and You agree to release us from any and all liability associated therewith. We encourage You to
                      report all user-to-user disputes to law enforcement officials, or a certified mediation or
                      arbitration entity. When appropriate, we also encourage you to report disputes involving fraud,
                      theft, or other criminal activity to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.</p>
                    <p><strong>21. Prohibited and Restricted Items.&nbsp;</strong>You may not list any shipment on our
                      site that violates any applicable law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or includes prohibited
                      items. Prohibited items are defined as hazardous or dangerous goods that may pose a danger to
                      health, safety, or property while being transported (such as explosives, radioactive materials,
                      flammable gases and solids, and toxic substances). Hazardous goods that cannot be shipped through
                      the mail or commercial carrier are not allowed on uShip. The few hazardous materials that lawfully
                      may be transported under certain conditions (if they are properly packaged and labeled) may be
                      listed on uShip - provided that the listing contains a clear notice of the hazardous nature of the
                      material and a description of the planned method of shipping that complies with the law. For
                      details on particular hazardous substances and transportation requirements in the US, see
                      the&nbsp;<a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Postal

                      requirements outside of the U.S., please consult your local postal authority and/or regulatory
                      agency. Restricted Items are defined as items considered restricted or perishable by the U.S.
                      Postal Service which generally do not pose a danger to health, safety, or property while being
                      transported, but their transport is regulated or banned for public policy reasons. Generally,
                      restricted or perishable items that can lawfully be transported by mail or commercial carrier are
                      permitted on uShip (see&nbsp;<a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/pub52/" target="_blank"

                      responsibility rests with the consigner to comply with all postal and non-postal laws and
                      regulations that relate to the mailing of hazardous, restricted, and perishable material. Anyone
                      who sends, or causes to be sent, a non-mailable or improperly packaged hazardous material can be
                      subject to legal penalties (i.e. fines and/or imprisonment), including, but not limited to, those
                      specified in 18 U.S.C.</p>

                      Administration (FMCSA), part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, administers laws and
                      regulations for the protection of Shippers of household goods. Your TSP is required by the FMCSA
                      to provide You with certain information pertaining to a household goods move. You can determine

                      strictly prohibited. All obligations contained in this Section 26 shall survive the termination of
                      this Agreement. Furthermore, You acknowledge that Our Information is proprietary, confidential,
                      and extremely valuable to us, and that we would be materially damaged by your disclosure of Our
                      Information. You acknowledge and agree that monetary damages provide an insufficient remedy for
                      the breach of this confidentiality obligation, and that we shall be entitled to injunctive relief
                      in addition to recovery for damages.</p>
                    <p><strong>27. Taxes.&nbsp;</strong>You are solely responsible for any and all taxes, levies,
                      charges, and fees incurred or that may be payable to any taxing authority in connection with the
                      transactions hereunder, other than any income tax incurred by uShip.</p>
                    <p><strong>28. Record Keeping/Audit.&nbsp;</strong>uShip reserves the right to keep all records of
                      any and all transactions and communications between You and other users for administration
                      purposes in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. All records will be kept in
                      accordance with applicable privacy laws and regulations.</p>
                    <p><strong>29. Non-solicitation.&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the term of
                        this Agreement You shall not solicit to hire nor hire our employees of whom You become aware of
                        through the performance of this Agreement. Furthermore, You shall not otherwise interfere with
                        any of uShip’s other business relationships including, but not limited to, those with other
                        uShip users, vendors, or business associates. Specifically, You shall not knowingly, directly or
                        indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit, divert, and/or send marketing content to any uShip
                        user in which you initially met through uShip.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>30. Unsolicited Idea Submission.&nbsp;</strong>We always want to receive messages and
                      feedback from uShip users and welcome any comments regarding the uShip marketplace. However, uShip
                      policy does not allow us to accept or consider ideas, suggestions, or proposals other than those
                      we specifically request. The intent of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future
                      misunderstandings when new functionality and features developed internally by uShip might be
                      similar or even identical to your idea.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If You do send uShip an unsolicited suggestion, idea, or
                        proposal, or if You send, at the request of uShip, a comment or suggestion to improve the uShip
                        Marketplace (for example, through discussion boards or via email) (collectively, the
                        "Submission"), uShip will consider the Submission to be non-confidential and non-proprietary.
                        uShip shall have no obligations concerning the Submission, contractual or otherwise (including,
                        but not limited to, an obligation to keep the Submission confidential), and shall not be liable
                        for any use or disclosure of any Submission. uShip shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the
                        Submission for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to
                        you.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>31. Remedies.&nbsp;</strong>If You use our Services in violation of this agreement, we
                      are authorized to take action against you as a user and/or take action against your uShip account
                      which may include, but is not limited to, the immediate removal of your shipment listing(s),
                      offers, bids, and/or profile, notifying our users of your actions, issuing a warning, temporarily
                      suspending your user status, terminating your user status, and/or refusing to provide our Services
                      to You in the future.</p>
                    <p><strong>32. Limited Liability and No Warranty.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge that we cannot
                      guarantee the continuous operation of or access to our sites, Services, or tools including those
                      of third-party solution providers. You further acknowledge that operation of and access to our
                      sites, Services, or tools including those of third-party solution providers may be interfered with
                      as a result of technical issues or numerous factors outside of our control. You agree that uShip
                      is not responsible for any failures, delays, outages, or otherwise not making the Services
                      available at any time.&nbsp;You agree that You are making use of our sites, Services, and tools
                      including those of third-party solution providers at your own risk, and that they are being
                      provided to You on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by
                      applicable law, we exclude all express or implied warranties, terms and conditions including, but
                      not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, warranties of title, and fitness for a
                      particular purpose.</p>
                    <p>In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable, and You agree not to
                      hold uShip responsible, for any damages or losses resulting in any way from the foregoing in this
                      Section 32, or the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Viruses or other malicious software obtained by accessing our Services, or tools linked to our

                      <li>Your need to modify practices, content, or behavior or your loss of or inability to do
                        business, as a result of changes to this Agreement or our policies;</li>
                      <li>Changes to the Service availability,&nbsp;including&nbsp;planned or unplanned Service

                      <li>Changes to any uShip products, features, or Services; and</li>
                      <li>Your removal from the uShip marketplace.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such
                      disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to You. In such jurisdictions, it is the intent of the
                      parties to this User Agreement to make clear that uShip’s liability is extremely limited and
                      provides its services “AS IS”, and if this User Agreement is modified by any Court of competent
                      jurisdiction to conform to local law, such modification shall be conducted while preserving the
                      original intent of the parties as closely as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>33. <a name="Indemnity"></a>Indemnity.&nbsp;</strong>You agree to indemnify and hold
                      uShip and our officers, directors, agents, advisors, attorneys, accountants, and employees
                      harmless from any claim or demand, including the cost of your attorneys' fees, made by any third
                      party due to or arising out of your negligence, breach of this Agreement, misuse of uShip’s
                      Services, or violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>
                    <p><strong>34. Legal Compliance.&nbsp;</strong>You shall comply with all applicable domestic and
                      international laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations regarding your use of the uShip Services
                      and your listing, shipping, transporting, and solicitation of offers to ship and transport items.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>35. Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions.&nbsp;</strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION
                      CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT IS AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES (“<strong>ARBITRATION
                        AGREEMENT</strong>”) AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
                      AGREE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR
                      JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, BUT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT CHOOSE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE RESOLVED
                      THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY
                      NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL. In
                      consideration for our willingness to provide you with access to our sites, Services, or tools, you
                      and we agree as follows:&nbsp; Any legal claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our
                      Services (excluding legal action taken by uShip to collect our fees or recover damages for, or
                      obtain an injunction relating to, the uShip operations, intellectual property, or Our
                      Information), shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial
                      arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association, including, if necessary, the Optional
                      Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection. The arbitration shall be conducted in Austin, Texas,
                      and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court having jurisdiction
                      thereof.&nbsp;<strong>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS SECTION 35 MUST BE
                        ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
                        ONE CLIENT OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
                        OTHER CLIENT OR USER. </strong><strong>YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN
                        ANY SUCH COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>36. Trademark and Domain Name Protection.&nbsp;</strong>The uShip Services contain
                      trademarks, trade names, trade dress, service marks, domain names, and other indicia of ownership
                      (collectively the "Marks") owned or licensed for use by uShip. Unless otherwise agreed to in an
                      Addendum to this Agreement, You agree that no right, property, license, permission, or interest of
                      any kind in or to the Marks is or is intended to be given or transferred to or acquired by You
                      pursuant to the execution, performance or non-performance of this Agreement or any part thereof.
                      You shall in no way contest or deny the validity of, our right of title to or license of use for,
                      the Marks, and You shall not encourage or assist others directly or indirectly to do so, during
                      the lifetime of this Agreement and thereafter. You shall not utilize the Marks in any manner that
                      would diminish their value or harm their reputation. You may not frame or utilize framing
                      techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images,
                      text, page layout, or form) of the uShip Services without express written consent. You may not use
                      any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing uShip’s name or trademarks without the express
                      written consent of uShip. You shall not use or register any domain name that is identical to or
                      similar to any of the Marks. To the greatest extent possible, uShip’s rights in our Marks and Our
                      Information shall be enforceable and respected worldwide.</p>

                      personal information, including firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL). We utilize several
                      different security techniques to protect data from unauthorized access, but we cannot guarantee
                      the security of our system. We also do not guarantee uninterrupted or secure access to our system,
                      as the operation of our Services can be interrupted by numerous factors outside of our control.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>39. Governing Law.&nbsp;</strong>THIS AGREEMENT AND YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES SHALL BE
                      GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.</p>
                    <p><strong>40. Other Terms and Conditions.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge and agree that we have the
                      sole discretion to set forth and post additional terms and conditions for your use of the uShip

                      conditions shall be incorporated herein. Furthermore, You expressly agree that, if there is any

                      its express terms. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not
                      affect the validity of this Agreement as a whole, and any such provision should be enforced by
                      authorities and reconstructed if need be, to apply to the maximum extent allowable under
                      applicable law. The failure by either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this
                      Agreement, to exercise any election or option provided herein, or to require at any time the
                      performance of the other of any of the provisions herein will not in any way be construed as a
                      waiver of such provisions. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs will be awarded to the prevailing
                      party in the event of litigation or arbitration involving the enforcement or interpretation of
